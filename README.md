# What is [OneVersion](http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/231062-oneversion)?

![OneVersion](http://i.imgur.com/BcXum7X.png) is a Wildstar add-on which tracks the versions of supported add-ons, shares the version information between group members, and provides several in-game alerts
when a group member has a newer version of a supported add-on than you.
